        <h1 class="zoomIn">Hello There!</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: 550;">My name is <span class="Funky-word-box"> Kombe Kampanga</span> and I am a 22 year old aspiring <span class="Funky-word-box" id="right-twist">software  </span> and <span class="Funky-word-box" id="left-twist">web developer!</span></p>
        <br>

        <p>What I love about programming is that there is always a way to make something even bigger, better or faster! That is what technology is all about, and the idea of being at the forefront of that is so exciting!</p>
        <p>I would love to help people bring their ideas to life, no matter how abstract they are! I love that coding allows us to take ideas from our heads and turn them into tangible functional products that make peoples lives easier, or just a bit more fun!</p>
        <p>I am currently in my <span class="Funky-word-box2">prenultimate year</span> of a Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science conjoint degree at the University of Auckland and <span class="Funky-word-box">I can't wait to get into the world of tech!</span> </p>

            <h2>Wait, Mechanical Engineering?</h2>
            <p>In my first year of engineering I wasn't sure which specialisation to go into. I loved the idea of learning how things work and the mechanisms involved, but I also felt so drawn to sotware development. My first ever programming assignment we had to find a secret code hidden in the pixels of an image, which made me feel like a secret agent and I was hooked.</p>
            <p>One of my good friends then suggested I pick up a conjoint and thank God for her because it was the best decision ever!!</p>
            <p>I have been working as a Mechanical Engineer at a building services consultancy called <a id="NDYlink" href="https://ndy.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Norman Disney & Young </strong></a> for the past 2 years. Here I helped design sustainable heating and ventillation systems for commercial buildings. </p>
            <p id="right-place-for-me"> <strong> I'm ready to embrace both worlds! </strong></p>

        <p style="margin-top: -2%;">I am currently using python tkinter to create a <span style="color: #16a2a7;"> <strong>program that chooses my outfits for me! </strong> </span></p>
        <p> I saw the idea in one of my favourite movies Clueless so I decided to recreate it, but add more functionalities to it such as selecting clothes based on the weather and the occasion! </p>
        <p>It has been so much fun to make and I still have a lot of features that I plan on adding to it, such as</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Automatically selecting the weather based on real weather reports</li>
            <li>Being able to save outfits to 'my favourites'</li>
            <li>Let the user customise the wardrobe colours</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>This has been an ongoing project because just when I think I'm done I keep thinking of ways to make it better! Once I have the main program down I plan on recreating it in other languages to develop my skills (Maybe turn it into a mobile app?!)</p>

            <p> This website is great for testing out the web development skills I have been learning in class/ in my spare time and is a place for me to experiment and have fun! </p>
            <p>I will continue to add to it as I learn more and will switch up the style as my personal style changes, so <span style="color: #16a2a7;"> <strong>stay tuned!</strong></p>

        <h2>AT-Hop App</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: -2%;"><i style="font-size: small;">This is part of a friends personal project so keep it hush!</i></p>
        <article style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <video width="400" src="at-hop_Trim.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline style="float: left; padding-right: 20px; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">video</video>
            <br>
            <p><span>A friend of mine who is an industrial designer had a side project/idea to <strong style="color: #8c8be4;">improve the way we use AT Hop cards in Auckland</strong></span>. For those who don't know, in Auckland we use Hop cards to pay for rides on public transport.</p>
            <p>Currently, if you don't have enough money on your card, you have to get off the bus/train and find a top up booth. If you try to transfer money to your card online it takes about 48-72 hours to appear. This means if you run out of credit you will have to wait for the next bus/train/ferry etc. after you top up elsewhere, which can be very frustrating.</p>
            <p>My friend had the idea creating an app that allows people to use their phone to tag on instead of the Hop card, similar to the way Apple Pay can be used for paywave.</p>
            <p>The app will also allow users to transfer money immediately if their balance is low, so they don't need to miss the bus anymore.</p>
            <p><strong style="color: #8c8be4;"> He created amazing visuals for the app and asked me to bring it to life!</strong></p>
            <p>I had never made an app before or used React, so it was exciting for us both when I was able to do it!</p>
            <p><strong style="color: #8c8be4;">Here are the images he rendered for the app idea:</strong></p>
            <img width="500" src="Hop-visuals.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="hop card visuals">
            <p><strong style="color: #8c8be4;">And to the left (or above for mobile users) is the app I published using React-Native!</strong></p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>This project was <strong style="color: #8c8be4;">SO MUCH FUN</strong> and a perfect example of what I love about programming!</p>
            <p>This is <strong style="color: #8c8be4;">exactly the type of work I want to be doing</strong> - helping turn people's ideas into reality! It's the best feeling ever!</p>
